Project Details:
This small project will be to go over and use object classes.  This practice will assist in reinforcing the lessons we learned last week. The main objectives to achieve are as follows:
- Use nested arrays and objects.
- Combine objects, arrays, and functions.
- Create a class to define the blueprint for creating objects.
- Add methods to a class.
- Set properties on an instance of a class.
- Make an instance of each class customizable.
- Create methods to alter the properties of an instance.
- Develop a class that inherits attributes from a "parent" class.
- Create static properties for a class.
- Create a "factory."
